# E-commerce Back End Starter Code

## Description

This code will allow you seed and access the database for an Ecommerce site and perform RESTful and CRUD operations to it. I couldn't get the seed data to load into my server because I kept getting this error:

node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:1078
  throw err;
  ^

Error: Cannot find module 'C:\Users\JAKE S\Desktop\UNCC Coding Bootcamp\Challenge-13\Ecommerce\seeds'

but although I couldn't figure out how to fix this, the rest of the code should be correct I think.
